# Schelling Index: Measuring Decentralized Racism in the Chicago Housing Market

This thesis was build using Dissertate

## Dissertate: a LaTeX dissertation template [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/suchow/Dissertate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/suchow/Dissertate)

This package provides all the files needed to support the production and typesetting of a PhD dissertation at Harvard, Princeton, UChicago and NYU, though it can easily be adapted to meet the requirements of other schools. The format and styling is based closely on the requirements published by each university's registrar.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Andrew Leifer for many code and README contributions and to Clemens Eppner for the Ubuntu instructions.

## Note: This template has been preloaded into Overleaf (www.overleaf.com) to make it possible to get started without needing to install anything, and this README file has been updated to reflect this.
